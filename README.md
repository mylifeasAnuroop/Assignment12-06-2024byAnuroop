Research Paper: MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract
This research project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers. We explore the impact of data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and visualization techniques on model performance. The project provides insights into training dynamics, evaluation metrics, and an interactive visualization of model behavior.
