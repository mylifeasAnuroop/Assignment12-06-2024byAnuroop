Abstract
This research project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers. We explore the impact of data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and visualization techniques on model performance. The project provides insights into training dynamics, evaluation metrics, and an interactive visualization of model behavior.

1. Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, has been a benchmark dataset for decades. This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify these digits.

2. Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. It is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The images are preprocessed by scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((train_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
test_images = test_images.reshape((test_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)
3. Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
4. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Data augmentation is applied to the training images to improve model generalization. This includes rotation, width and height shifts, zoom, and shear transformations.

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=10,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1
)
datagen.fit(train_images)
5. Training Strategy
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. A learning rate scheduler adjusts the learning rate during training epochs.

python
Copy code
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

def lr_scheduler(epoch):
    if epoch < 5:
        return 0.001
    elif epoch < 10:
        return 0.0005
    else:
        return 0.0001

lr_schedule = LearningRateScheduler(lr_scheduler)

history = model.fit(datagen.flow(train_images, train_labels, batch_size=32),
                    epochs=15, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels),
                    callbacks=[lr_schedule])
6. Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set to measure its accuracy and performance.

python
Copy code
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"\nTest accuracy: {test_acc}\n")
7. Visualization
Visualization of the training process includes plots of accuracy and loss over epochs, as well as a confusion matrix to visualize classification performance.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Plot training history (accuracy and loss)
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Train Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Confusion matrix
Y_pred = model.predict(test_images)
Y_pred_classes = np.argmax(Y_pred, axis=1)
Y_true = np.argmax(test_labels, axis=1)
confusion_mtx = tf.math.confusion_matrix(Y_true, Y_pred_classes)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(confusion_mtx, annot=True, fmt='g', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted labels')
plt.ylabel('True labels')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves a high accuracy rate on the test set after training with data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout. The visualization of training dynamics and model performance metrics provides valuable insights into its behavior.

9. Future Work
Future work could focus on exploring more advanced architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods to further improve classification accuracy. Additionally, deploying the model in a production environment or integrating it into a web application for digit recognition could be explored.
